Exercise

AppModule has only one service: create a service that has a method getOnlineData
that returns an array of JSON objects from https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10
and save the results in localStorage.

The service has another method getcachedData that return the JSON objects from
localStorage.

When App starts, it should fetch all the online data, stringify it, and save it into the
localStorage.

Exercise part 2

Create another feature module called Users that is responsible for showing a list of
users, your application should only load this module upon navigating via users link.
Within Users module we have two components:

* users component

* userdetails component

Both components will retrieve data from localStorage

When users click on users/:uuid you should display userdetails child component
with full details about the user.

If a user tried to visit users/:uuid page without passing a correct uuid, then your
app must redirect them to a friendly error page. (use Guards).

Write this exercise with Lazy Loading in mind.
