<h2>Explain Why do we want somethionge to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeOut</h2>
<p> answerd: the first thing that i noticed is that the SetImmediate does not work 
in all the browsers, i try to do it in this document but does not work, about the queue firts the event loop execute the 
the timers and then the check that means that something in the check queue needs to wait until finish tiemrs, U/O, IDLE, 
INCOMING CONNECTIONS and in this momment execute, in this case probably y need that it happens in other ways is more faster timer.
<h2>Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate</h2>
<p> answerd: the process.nextTick is like the interruption system, it happens inmeditly 
when there is something and interrup the event loop, does not matter if it is finish or not in the case of 
setImmediate is executed after the 4 queue named previously.
