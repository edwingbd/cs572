<h2>Explain Why do we want somethinge to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeOut</h2>
<p> 
the event loop is waiting in the idle process, for that reason setItmmediatly is the first to execute and the the the timer, 
I noticed is that the SetImmediate does not work until use the node, about the queue first the event loop execute the incoming connection, 
then check, then close, then timers and then the check that means that something in the checking queue needs to wait until finish timers, 
U/O, IDLE, INCOMING CONNECTIONS and at this moment execute, in this case probably y need that it happens in other ways is faster timer..
<h2>Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate</h2>
<p> answerd: the process.nextTick is like the interruption system, it happens inmeditly 
when there is something and interrup the event loop, does not matter if it is finish or not in the case of 
setImmediate is executed after the 4 queue named previously.
