// Exercise Write a Reactive Node program that has a function checkSystem() that checks if the system memory size is at least 4 GB 
// and the processor has more than 2 cores (use os core module). 1. When you call the function, you should receive an immediate message
//  on the console "Checking your system...". 2. If the system doesn't have enough memory we should print a message to the console:
//   "This app needs at least 4 GB of RAM" 3. If the system doesn't have at least 2 cores, print this message to the console: 
//   "Processor is not supported" 4. If the system has enough specs, print the following message "System is checked successfully."
